# Embedded Systems - Winter 2024
## Final Project

### **Description**
The core concept of this project is to control LED lights in a “smart-home” environment. Utilizing an accelerometer, the system will enable users to manipulate the lighting with simple wrist gestures. A flick upwards on the wrist, with the board attached, will activate the lights, while a downward flick will turn them off. The incorporation of IoT technology is a key feature of this project. Additionally, we hope to use the IR receiver for the user to also turn on the light by manual input (TV remote). By connecting to AWS IoT Core, the system will offer remote control capabilities, allowing users to manage the lights from any internet-connected device. This integration not only adds convenience but also opens up possibilities for further automation and integration with other smart-home devices.

In our specific design, we were able to turn the onboard LED light off depending on the orientation of the board and we were also able to control the lights manually from inputs in AWS IOT. We also had the remote controlling sequences of lights but unfortunately, due to pin usage, we were only able to control one light with the remote.
